# Student-Attrition-Prediction
This program was designed to predict the probability of first year university students dropping out of university. Various different ML algoritims are used. 

Disclaimer: This program is unfinished because my mother* needed a ML example to show her students. I was going to make this program for her, but she ended up using a different example in the end. I may return to finish my work here when I finish my tasks.

*My mom is an ECE professor and she was teaching a class on ML a few months ago.
